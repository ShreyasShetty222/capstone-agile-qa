# Agile Starter Kit (JIRA + QA)

This folder contains ready-to-use templates for your Capstone:
- Backlog (user stories) CSV
- Sprint plan (Markdown)
- Tasks CSV
- X-Ray (or Test Mgmt) Test Cases CSV
- RTM (Requirements Traceability Matrix) CSV
- Bug report template (Markdown)
- Definition of Done (Markdown)
- Test Execution Checklist (Markdown)

## Suggested Use in JIRA
1. Create a **Scrum** project in Jira Cloud.
2. Create **Backlog** issues (Story) from `Backlog.csv` (manual entry is fine, or CSV import if allowed).
3. Start **Sprint 1** and move stories into the sprint.
4. Add **Tasks/Sub-tasks** from `Tasks.csv` to each story.
5. Add **Test** issues in Xray (or keep test cases in `XRay-TestCases.csv` if Xray isn't available).
6. Use `RTM.csv` to map **Story ↔ Test Cases** for traceability.
7. When you find defects, use `Bug-Template.md` to log them consistently.

Good luck!
